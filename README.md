# 7 Databases in 7 Weeks

This repository contains my work and notes as I progress through the book "7 Databases in 7 Weeks". The book covers a range of modern database technologies, focusing on practical usage and conceptual understanding.

- Databases are essential for understanding and leveraging data, much like the importance of oil in energy and industry.
- Gaining knowledge of databases enhances one's ability to manage and utilize the growing corpus of data for various projects or entrepreneurial ventures.
- "NoSQL" represents a range of non-relational database systems that have become mainstream in technology, complementing traditional SQL databases.
- Both NoSQL and SQL databases continue to evolve and are crucial in expanding the applications of data.
- The book explores seven different databases across five genres, providing a comprehensive understanding of modern database technologies.
- It is designed for application developers and data engineers, offering practical exercises and discussions to deepen understanding of each database system.
- The book encourages a linear reading to build on concepts progressively, as some are only introduced in detail in early chapters.
- The focus is on practical usage and conceptual understanding, rather than installation and detailed administration of databases.
